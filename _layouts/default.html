        <p class="page_content-text">
          During our workshops, we will invite participants to join us in greeting seeds, plants, and trees - in Dakhóta. We will also learn how to say a few native plant names. This part of the workshop will be led by Cassandra Meyer, who has been learning and teaching Dakhóta for the past twenty years.
        </p>
        <p class="page_content-text">
          We also welcome you to listen to the audio file in advance so you can practice saying these greetings and plant names as you walk through a park or even your own neighborhood. Artwork below is by Kira Vega.
